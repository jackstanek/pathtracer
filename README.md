# Pathtracer

This is a pathtracer that I'm writing as a little hobby project to
learn more about global illumination and Monte Carlo rendering. It's
based off a toy raytracer I built for my Intro to Computer Graphics
class last semester.

## Compilation

The project uses CMake as its build system. It doesn't have any
external requirements. Build it as you would any other CMake project.

## Usage

Type `./pt -h` for usage help.
